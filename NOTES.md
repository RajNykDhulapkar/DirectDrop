# STEPS

1. Set up the Backend: Use Go to create a server that will serve as the backbone of the application. This server will handle the file transfers and communication between the peers.

1. Implement the Peer Discovery: Implement a mechanism to discover other peers on the network. This can be done using a centralized server or a decentralized solution like a distributed hash table (DHT).

1. Handle File Transfers: Implement the file transfer functionality that allows clients to upload and download files from each other. This can be done using WebRTC data channels or by using a protocol like BitTorrent.

1. Implement the Frontend: Use React.js to build the frontend of the application. The frontend should allow users to search for files, upload files, and download files.

1. Integrate the Frontend and Backend: Integrate the frontend and backend by using APIs to communicate between them. The frontend should send requests to the backend to perform operations like uploading or downloading files.

1. Add Security Measures: Add security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the files being shared. This can be done by implementing encryption or authentication.

1. Test and Deploy: Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly. Once you are satisfied with the results, deploy the application to a hosting platform so that others can use it.
